## Alessia Pascoli

**Profile**: I am a recent graduate in Astrophysics from the University of Padova. I am passionate about data analysis and computational modelling and I am eager to explore the potential of numerical methods, AI and machine learning to address complex interdisciplinary challenges.

**Content**: This portfolio includes a collection of Python projects I developed during my Master studies. Each repository contains the main code in the form of a Jupyter notebook, a short description of the project and additional data files when needed. Hope you enjoy!
